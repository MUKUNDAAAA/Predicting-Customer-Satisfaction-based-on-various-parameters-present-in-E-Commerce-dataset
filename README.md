Background of the Problem
E-commerce is rapidly growing, and understanding factors affecting customer satisfaction, as expressed in ratings and reviews, is crucial for businesses. Online reviews significantly influence future purchases.

Importance
Customer satisfaction directly impacts company sales. Improving satisfaction can lead to increased future sales.

Objectives
Analyze the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset on Kaggle to determine customer satisfaction.

Data Science Solution
Data science can analyze relationships between parameters like delivery time, price, and product quality against customer ratings using machine learning techniques. Identifying key factors can help businesses improve customer satisfaction.

Data Sources and Models
Primary Data: Brazilian e-commerce dataset from GitHub.
Data Models: Includes various datasets like customers, products, sellers, orders, reviews, payments, items, and geolocation.
Size: 45MB, ~95K records over 2 years.
Preprocessing: Not required.
Project Phases
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect, clean, and prepare data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand relationships between features and target variables.
Model Building: Train and fine-tune machine learning models.
Testing and Model Evaluation: Validate model performance on unseen data.
Deployment and Reporting: Deploy the model and report findings.
Methods/Models
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Justification
These methods are suitable for binary classification, handle complex and non-linear data, manage high-dimensional data, provide feature importance, and are robust to missing and noisy data, ensuring good performance and generalization.
