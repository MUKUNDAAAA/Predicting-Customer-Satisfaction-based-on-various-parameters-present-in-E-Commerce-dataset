Background of the problem
E-commerce is growing rapidly, and understanding what factors affect customer satisfaction, as expressed in ratings and reviews, is essential for any business.
Online reviews are an important part of the customer journey and can influence future purchases.
Why is it important?
Customer Satisfaction has direct implication towards company sales. By improving customer satisfaction there will be increase in company future sales.
Objectives of the project
The objective of this project is to analyze the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset on Kaggle to determine customer satisfaction.
How can Data Science solve the problem?
Data science can be used to analyze the relationship between various parameters like delivery time, price, product etc… against customer ratings. This can be done by using techniques of machine learning.
By identifying the factors that most influence customer ratings, businesses can take steps to improve and increase customer satisfaction.
